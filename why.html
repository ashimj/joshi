      <h2>”Why?” is a VVI question</h2>
      <h5>January, 2020
<!--      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>-->
      <p>This nature where we have started crawling up is full of wonders, from every flake of snow
to the twinkling night sky bulbs. If we see the six folded symmetry of the snowflakes-how
mesmerizing they are, the similarity among the patterns of eyes, leaves, the gastropod shell
which are described by the golden ratio and in turns which is led by the sequence of the
numbers called Fibonacci Sequence, the similarity between the rhythm of the binary numbers
and the solving of the Tower of Hanoi, breaking of the enigma, predictions of the particles
by the mathematical equations, accuracy in telling the future position of the stars and the
astronomical events- they all are so beautiful that‘s why I always ask why so?, why only those
numbers? Or are there any other numbers? why that pattern? why that is like that ?
<br>
<br>
As a child and since then I have been always fascinated by the creation of nature and by their
accuracy. And the same fascination has led me to write a few words today. We, humans,
have been describing the natural phenomenon with numbers and different laws, and we
have succeeded in describing them and predicting them with/without negligible error. The
creation of thousands of natural laws and mathematical equations have made our daily life
very convenient. With those same equations we sent humans up to the moon, I could say
that there will be 5 solar eclipses in the year of 2904, I could tell you the time you slow when
you move fast, we can calculate the amount of energy from the half of gram of the Plutonium
fission, I can tell you that with some exceptions the numbers of the leaves of the flower
are only 1 or 2 or 3 or 5 or 8 or 13 or 21…. and the consequence of the same nature-our
consciousness. These things are very beautiful to observe and to calculate them are joyful
but the joy multiplies when we think with our conscious mind and ask why?
<br>
<br>
What I say is the single most important thing to reveal the nature or to know our existence
is Curiosity. Humankind has developed so much of these laws, theories, machines and discovered so many wonders, patterns and mysteries are of cost of the curiosity followed by the
imagination. The same pattern of curiosity will be our breakthroughs in the vast webs of space
and time. We find something not knowing it is there but while finding the answer of why is
something so? I guess we can say curiosity is the source of potential to do something new and
the same thing applies everywhere. With the curiosity to know nature, with the imagination to
bring change-we make the diamond to the society that lights the next generation to the path
of the inquisitiveness and the same pattern repeats. And that‘s why I think the goals of the
schools should not be to educate students but instead to sew the seeds of the curiosity to ask
why so they can educate themselves.
<br>
<br>
In this vast arena of nature, we humans are comparable to smaller than the dust. We asked why and dreamed high that in turn made us this much successful yet. But there are still so
many questions to be answered, mainly our own existence- the existence of the universe.
This universe where we live upon consists of everyone and everything we know hitherto- your
family, the one you love, your best friends, your enemies, your certificates, tears you shade,
the smile you show up, the gold you shine, the letters that I‘m typing, the sound wave of the
tik tok of the clock and everything else. But have you ever imagined beyond these? Are there
more than these? Have you ever tried to count the stars? Or tried to touch the rainbow? What
about the information after the decay of the black holes?
<br>
<br>
With the simple thought experiment, Einstein changed the universe that our ancestors used to
see. Many theories supported by technological advancements and the breakthrough of Hubble
in the astronomy brought radical change. Since then we have gathered so much knowledge
about our universe. We say universe started about 13 billion years ago and even we say It
took 380,000 years for electrons to be trapped in orbits around nuclei, forming the first atoms.
But we don‘t know what was before that 13 billion years. And we should not hesitate to say
“we don‘t know” followed by “we intend to know”.
<br>
<br>
As Carl Sagan said we all are star stuff. Not only us but everything is made of the same thing
called Atom. We bunch of atoms studying about the atoms have Consciousness but others
do not. But since we don‘t know what is consciousness or how it looks like, does it have any
structures or patterns or any source we can‘t say other things do not have consciousness.
Maybe they can have in any other form that we don‘t know yet. We all are questioners that‘s
why we should not stop asking questions. The only difference between the question of the
kid and the adult is the length of the question, otherwise, everything is the same. We used
to ask how the clock moves and now we ask is this time and space where we live only an
illusion? We used to ask about the rainbow now we are talking about the consciousness of the
mind with which we saw rainbows. Such interesting questions are so beautiful that none of
the miss world or the miss universe-the universe where only the lives are known to be in the
earth-could beat. Who knows there are more highly intelligent lives lurking behind the stars
or only the bacteria have been developed so far. But I tell you after looking at flat earthers
my belief about the alien increases more and more.

The goals of the schools should not be to educate students but instead to sew the seeds of the
curiosity to ask why so they can educate themselves.
